    <h2>About Me</h2><hr>
<img src="assets/images/rsaing.jpg" alt="Ranock Saing" style="float:left;width:150px;height:160px;margin-right:30px;">

 <p>I am an opened-minded, easy-going, enthusiastic, and honest individual who can impress you with my humor, leaving you entertained. As an ISFP, I love trying new things. I can proudly say the most daring fear provoking thing I've done was sky diving. When I am discouraged with my studies, the intention to change my situation keeps me grounded.  </p>

<p>I classify myself as a foodie. I love trying new foods. Although, I do not have a favorite, I'd say chicken curry is at the top of my list. In my freetime, I love spending time with my friends and boyfriend, Momo. My cat, Dora LV, brings joy to my life. Motivated by financial freedom, I refrain from over spending. My all time recommended book for anyone would be "Early Retirement Extreme". Learning to live a different lifestyle, making changes to my old lifestyle have helped me be more responsible.</p>
